# Senza-FastApi
This is a boilerplate/starter project for a fullstack web app using PyScript+Senza, FastApi, and your DB of choice 
(as well as the dev environment for senza core)

## IMPORTANT!
I have broken the orginal project up, so the core senza library is more modular and could be more easily used across frameworks. senza core is here, https://github.com/Phelsong/senza 

## What is Senza?
senza is a lightweight wrapper around the dom api already offered with pyscript, with a few added features, namely: 
- more composable ui elements 
- end-to-end type annotations 
- a lightweight DOM router, for quickly building page navigation
- a more through websocket implementation
- web compiler/minifier [wip]
- more to come 

## How to use
Simply fork and customize, the core senza changes are in the submodule.
